3) https://github.com/kaiwu-astro/Nbody6PPGPU-beijing/blob/dev/examples/03_HDF5_Basics.ipynb

   and one jupyter notebook provided by Rainer Spurzem:

4) https://github.com/kaiwu-astro/Nbody6PPGPU-beijing/blob/dev/examples/readhdf5.ipynb


   Here is some explanation what they are good for:

First) Reading data from the main stdout file, for example Lagrangian radii
Second)
Third) Reading several snapshots from the HDF5 Files, to make time dependent plots (here energy for example), as well as single and multiple HRD's.
Fourth) Reading one snapshot as an example, and creating an N-body style enviroment with variables like ZMBAR, VSTAR, BODY, NAME, X1,... V1, ... ASPN, ... and so on, and three example plots (phase space, z-angular momentum, HRD).
